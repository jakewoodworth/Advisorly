title: Cancellation and Substitution Deadlines

Cancellation and substitution deadlines help the event team finalize badges, seating, and catering. Most conferences allow cancellations with a refund—often minus an administrative fee—until a published date a few weeks before the event. After that cutoff, refunds are generally unavailable, but substitutions are typically permitted through an online portal or by contacting registration. Substitutions are often allowed up to a week before the conference and sometimes even on site, though on‑site changes may take extra time for badge reprinting. Check your confirmation email and the registration page for the exact dates and any fees. If your plans are uncertain, consider registering closer to the early‑bird deadline rather than the final cutoff, balancing price with flexibility. For group registrations, the organizer can usually manage substitutions for multiple attendees in a single request. If you need an exception due to extenuating circumstances, reach out promptly with documentation so the team can advise on options.
