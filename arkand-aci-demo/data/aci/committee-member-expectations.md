Committee service is collaborative and time‑aware. Members are expected to: (1) attend scheduled meetings or review summaries if absent; (2) contribute to discussions with practical insights; (3) complete small action items between meetings when accepted; and (4) observe any antitrust, confidentiality, and code‑of‑conduct rules. Typical time commitment ranges from one to three hours per month, increasing briefly around deliverables such as surveys, comment letters, or event planning. Chairs will share a yearly plan so you can anticipate peaks. Participation is inclusive—new voices are welcome, and contributions can be as simple as sharing a template, offering a case study, or connecting the group with a subject‑matter expert. If your role changes or you need a break, update your preferences; you can rejoin later as capacity allows. Above all, be respectful, prepared, and responsive so the committee can produce useful outcomes for the broader membership.
