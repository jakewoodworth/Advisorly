Most conferences offer refunds up to a published deadline, often minus a small administrative fee. After that date, refunds are typically unavailable, but registrations can often be transferred to a colleague from the same organization. To request a refund, email the registration team with your confirmation number and reason for cancellation; refunds are usually issued to the original payment method. Always review the event’s policy on the registration page for exact dates and any exceptions. Hotel bookings made through a room block must be canceled separately and follow the hotel’s rules. If you have an emergency that affects travel, contact the event team as soon as possible—some exceptions can be considered on a case‑by‑case basis. For the best flexibility and pricing, register before the early‑bird deadline and note the cancellation cutoff in your calendar.
