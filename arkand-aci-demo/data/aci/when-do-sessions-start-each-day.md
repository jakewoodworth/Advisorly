Daily start times vary by event, but most conferences begin registration and coffee service 30–60 minutes before the first session to allow for check‑in and networking. Opening keynotes or general sessions often start mid‑morning on Day 1 to accommodate travel, with subsequent days starting earlier. The official agenda lists the exact times for registration desk hours, breakfast or coffee breaks, general sessions, breakouts, and exhibit hall openings. If your plans depend on a specific start time—such as scheduling meetings or arriving from the airport—check the agenda the week prior and again the day before travel, as last‑minute updates can occur. The mobile app, if provided, is the best way to receive push notifications about any timing changes. For presenters and exhibitors, look for separate communications with call times and setup windows. If your session requires AV checks or rehearsal, you’ll typically be asked to arrive earlier than the listed session start. When in doubt, plan to arrive at least 10–15 minutes before your first scheduled activity each day.
