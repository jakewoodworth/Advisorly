If you’re exploring sponsorship or exhibit options, the fastest route is to contact the teams listed on the event website. For sponsorship, look for a “Sponsor” or “Partner” page and share your budget range, objectives (brand visibility, thought leadership, lead gen), and preferred assets (reception, signage, session). For exhibiting, visit the “Exhibit” or “Exhibitor Information” page and include your company, desired booth size, and any special requirements (corner, island, rigging). Both forms route inquiries to the appropriate manager so you receive accurate availability, pricing, and deadlines.

If you already have a booth space, reference your booth number so staff can review your file and coordinate bundled opportunities with the sponsorship team when relevant. During show week, the exhibitor service desk on the floor resolves time‑sensitive issues quickly—keep their contact details handy. To plan effectively, request the current prospectus and exhibitor services manual; these outline inventory, production timelines, and ordering instructions so you can meet deadlines and maximize your presence.
