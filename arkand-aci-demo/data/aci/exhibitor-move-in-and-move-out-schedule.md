Move‑in and move‑out schedules are set to ensure a safe, orderly show floor. Your target move‑in date and dock time will be listed in the exhibitor services manual or in a confirmation email from the decorator. If you ship advance to the warehouse, your freight will be delivered to your booth according to the published schedule; direct‑to‑show shipments should arrive only during designated hours to avoid refusal and off‑target fees. During move‑out, dismantle cannot begin until the show closes and aisles are clear; carriers must check in by the posted deadline to avoid forced freight or storage charges. Order material handling (drayage), electrical, and internet in advance, and keep copies of all orders on site for quick troubleshooting. If you need an early move‑in or extended setup window due to a large build, contact the exhibits manager before the deadline—accommodations are limited and must be approved in writing. Always ensure your booth is staffed during open hours and that removal follows the official schedule to maintain safety and compliance.
