title: What’s Included with Registration — And What Isn’t

A full‑conference registration typically includes access to general sessions, most breakouts, and the exhibit hall during posted hours, plus official networking breaks and any all‑attendee receptions. Your badge also grants on‑site support, access to the agenda/app, and, when available, post‑event materials for sessions that share them. Included food and beverage vary by event; look for meal icons in the agenda for breakfasts, breaks, or receptions that are covered.

Not included are add‑ons such as pre‑conference workshops, ticketed luncheons or tours, training with limited seating, and certain special events—these require separate registration or fees. Travel, lodging, and incidentals are always attendee responsibilities. Exhibitor‑only or invitation‑only functions are restricted to those groups. Lead retrieval, Wi‑Fi upgrades, CEU processing fees (if any), and recording access beyond standard attendee rights may also be excluded.

To avoid surprises, review the registration page’s “What’s Included” section and the agenda legend. If you’re considering a particular add‑on or need CEUs, confirm eligibility and costs before purchase. When in doubt, contact the registration team with your registration type and specific question—they can confirm what your badge covers so you can select the right options for your goals.
