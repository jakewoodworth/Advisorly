Your conference registration gives you access to the full attendee experience designed to make learning, networking, and planning easy. A standard full-conference badge typically includes admission to all general sessions and most breakout sessions on the published agenda, entry to the exhibit hall during open hours, and access to scheduled networking breaks and receptions listed as “all-attendee.” Your badge also covers on-site support services such as registration assistance, wayfinding, and access to the mobile agenda (if provided). Some meals and refreshments are included; look for details in the agenda where breakfast, coffee breaks, or receptions are noted. Pre-conference workshops, trainings with limited seating, tours, and special events may require separate registration or fees. Exhibitor-only or invitation-only activities are not included with an attendee badge. For the most accurate, up-to-date details, check the event agenda and the “What’s Included” note on the registration page, as offerings can vary by event and venue. If you need clarity on a specific item—like Wi‑Fi, CEU credits, or post-event materials—contact the event team before registering so you can select the registration type that best fits your goals.
