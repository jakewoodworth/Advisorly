You can note dietary restrictions during the registration process or by updating your attendee profile before the published deadline. Look for a “Dietary Needs” or “Accessibility & Accommodations” section and select all that apply (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten‑free, nut allergy). If your needs are complex, add a brief description so the event team can coordinate with the venue. After submitting, confirm that your selection appears in your confirmation email. If you don’t see this option during registration, contact the event team using the support email on the registration page; they can add a note to your record. For plated functions, some events distribute special meal tickets or mark your badge to inform catering; pick these up at registration if instructed. On site, if something is missing or unclear, speak with staff at the meal function as early as possible so they can arrange an alternative. Advance notice is the best way to ensure your needs are met across all official food functions.
