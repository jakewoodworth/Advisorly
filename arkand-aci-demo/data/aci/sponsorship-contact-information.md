For sponsorship inquiries, the fastest path is to contact the sponsor relations team listed on the event website. Look for a “Sponsorship” or “Partner With Us” page with a dedicated email address and, in many cases, a request form that routes your message to the right person. Share your objectives, budget range, and any specific assets you’re interested in (e.g., reception, signage, session sponsorship). If you’re exploring a custom package, include audience segments you want to reach and any preferred activation ideas; this helps the team propose options that align with your goals and the event’s guidelines. If you’re already an exhibitor, your account manager can connect you with sponsorship staff to coordinate bundled opportunities. During peak season, response times can vary, so include your timeline or any internal approval deadlines. For comprehensive details, request the current prospectus—it outlines inventory, pricing, and production deadlines so you can plan confidently.
