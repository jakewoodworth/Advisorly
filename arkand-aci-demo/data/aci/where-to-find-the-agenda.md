The latest agenda is always published on the event website and, when available, in the mobile app. Look for an “Agenda,” “Schedule,” or “Program” link in the site navigation. The online schedule provides session titles, speakers, room locations, and timing, and it’s updated as changes occur—making it the most accurate source leading up to and during the event. If the mobile app is offered, you can build a personal schedule, receive real‑time updates, and access maps and exhibitor listings. A printable PDF agenda is sometimes posted for planning purposes, but it may not reflect last‑minute adjustments. On site, signage and daily bulletins highlight any room changes or special notices. If you need an accessible format or assistance, contact the event team; they can help with large‑print schedules or alternate formats. For planning travel, focus on key anchor times like registration hours, opening sessions, exhibit hall hours, and evening receptions. Always recheck the agenda the week of the conference and the morning of each day for the most current information.
