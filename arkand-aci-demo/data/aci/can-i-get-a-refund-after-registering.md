title: Can I Get a Refund After I Register?

Whether you can receive a refund after registering depends on the event’s published policy and the date you make your request. Many conferences provide full or partial refunds if you cancel before a specific deadline—often a few weeks prior to the event—minus a small administrative fee. After the deadline, refunds are typically not available; however, you can usually transfer your registration to a colleague from the same organization at no cost or a modest transfer fee. To request a refund, email the registration team with your confirmation number, the name on the registration, and your reason for cancellation. If the registration was paid by credit card, the refund is typically issued to the original card; check with your finance team if a corporate card was used. For unusual circumstances, such as medical emergencies, contact the event organizer as soon as possible—exceptions are handled case‑by‑case. Be sure to cancel any hotel reservations separately, as hotel policies are managed independently from conference registration.
