On-site registration is often available as a convenience for last‑minute attendees, but availability can vary based on capacity, security requirements, and venue policies. If on-site registration is offered, you’ll typically find a dedicated counter near the main registration desk with posted hours on the event website and mobile app. Bring a government‑issued photo ID and a form of payment; some events are cashless and accept only credit cards. Be aware that on-site rates are frequently higher than advance purchase rates, and certain items—like workshops, tours, or special events—may sell out in advance and not be available for on-site purchase. To speed things up, review the agenda beforehand, know which pass type you need, and confirm any eligibility (e.g., member status). If your organization requires a purchase order or invoice, contact the registration team before you travel; those options might not be available on site. For the most accurate information, check the event’s registration page a few days before the conference for the latest on availability, hours, and acceptable payment methods.
