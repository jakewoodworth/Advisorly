title: Update Committee Preferences and Email Settings
source: demo
topic: committees

You can manage your committee participation and email preferences from your member profile. After logging in, navigate to “Committees” or “Interests” to add or remove committees and to “Communication Preferences” or “Subscriptions” to adjust email frequency. Many systems support options like immediate notices, daily digests, or a weekly summary. If you’re receiving duplicate messages, check whether you’re subscribed under multiple email addresses or profiles; consolidating accounts can help. For changes to organization name, title, or phone numbers, update your profile so rosters remain current. If you lose access to your login or leave your organization, contact membership support to transfer or deactivate your account. To reduce noise without missing important updates, keep at least one notification type enabled and add the association’s domain to your safe‑sender list. If your committee uses collaboration tools (e.g., forums or shared drives), preferences for those may be managed separately—watch the welcome email for instructions.
