Many conferences offer discounted rates to members of the hosting association. To receive member pricing, ensure your membership is active and that you register using the email address associated with your member record. Registration systems typically verify eligibility automatically; if your member rate isn’t appearing, log into your member account first or contact membership support to sync your profile. Discount structures vary—some events provide a flat reduction, while others offer early-bird member pricing, tiered rates, or group discounts for teams from the same organization. Note that member rates usually apply only to the primary attendee registration and may not extend to add-ons like workshops, tours, or guest passes. If your organization plans to send multiple participants, ask about bundled or corporate membership options that can increase savings. Always verify deadlines, as early-bird or advance rates can expire. If you recently joined or renewed, processing can take a short time; keep your receipt handy in case the registration team needs to confirm status and adjust your rate manually before you finalize payment.
