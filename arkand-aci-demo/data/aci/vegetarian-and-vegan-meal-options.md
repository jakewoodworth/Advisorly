Most conferences plan menus that include vegetarian and vegan options during official meal functions such as breakfasts, breaks, or receptions. These items may be clearly labeled at buffets or indicated on menu signage. For plated meals at ticketed lunches or dinners, you can usually request a vegetarian or vegan entrée in advance during registration or by updating your attendee profile before the published deadline. If you have severe allergies or require specialized accommodations (e.g., gluten‑free, kosher, halal), contact the event team ahead of time so they can coordinate with the venue. On site, if you don’t see a suitable option, ask a staff member at the meal function—they can check with catering for available alternatives. Availability of specialty meals can be limited without advance notice, so the earlier you flag your needs, the better. The event mobile app often includes notes about dietary accommodations and venue dining options, which can be helpful when planning between sessions.
