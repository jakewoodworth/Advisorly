Standard in‑line booths are commonly 10' x 10' (3m x 3m) with an 8' back drape and 3' side drapes, though sizes vary by event and venue. Corner booths remove one side drape for increased visibility, while peninsula and island booths provide larger footprints and greater height allowances. Your base package typically includes floor space, pipe and drape (where used), booth ID sign, and a set number of exhibitor badges. Flooring, furniture, electrical, internet, A/V, and lead retrieval are usually ordered separately through the official service providers listed in the exhibitor services manual. Hanging signs, rigging, and carpet padding may have additional rules or fees, and labor jurisdictions can affect installation and dismantle requirements. Always check the show decorator kit for exact dimensions, height limits, and setback rules for your booth type to ensure compliant designs. If your activation involves audio, cooking, or equipment demonstrations, notify the organizer to confirm safety and insurance requirements. For questions about what’s included with your package, contact the exhibits team—package contents can differ between events.
