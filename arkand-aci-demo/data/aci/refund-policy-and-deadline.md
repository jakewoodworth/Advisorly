title: Refund Policy and Cancellation Deadline

Most conferences offer refunds up to a posted deadline, often a few weeks before the event, minus a small administrative fee. After that cutoff, refunds are generally unavailable; however, you can typically transfer your registration to a colleague from the same organization. To request a refund, email the registration team with your confirmation number and reason for cancellation. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and may take one to two billing cycles to appear depending on your bank.

The cancellation deadline exists to finalize badges, room sets, and catering orders. You’ll find the exact date and any fees on the registration page and in your confirmation email. Mark the date in your calendar when you register. If your situation changes unexpectedly, contact the event team promptly—documented emergencies are reviewed case‑by‑case. Remember to cancel hotel reservations separately; hotels follow their own policies and timelines. If flexibility is important, consider registering by the early‑bird deadline and watch for the final cancellation date as you plan travel and internal approvals.
