title: What’s the deadline for cancellations or substitutions?

The cancellation and substitution deadlines are listed on the event’s registration page and in your confirmation email. Policies can vary by conference, but here’s the typical guidance:

- Cancellations: Refunds are usually available until a published deadline (often a few weeks before the event) and may be subject to a small administrative fee. After the deadline, refunds are generally not available.
- Substitutions: You can typically substitute a colleague from the same organization at no charge until shortly before the event. After on-site registration opens, substitutions may be handled at the registration desk.

How to proceed:

1. Check the registration page for the exact dates and fees.
2. Locate your confirmation number in your email.
3. Email the registration team to request a cancellation or to submit the substitute attendee’s full details (name, title, organization, email).

Notes:

- Hotel reservations must be cancelled separately and follow the hotel’s policy.
- If you miss the refund deadline, a substitution is often the best option.
- See also: “Refund Policy and Deadline” for an overview of typical timelines and fees.
