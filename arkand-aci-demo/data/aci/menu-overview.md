Menus vary by venue and season, but official conference functions typically offer light breakfast items, coffee breaks, and evening reception hors d’oeuvres. Events increasingly include labeled vegetarian and vegan selections, and major allergens are often identified on signage. For plated luncheons or dinners, attendees may preselect an entrée type during registration or indicate dietary needs for a chef’s alternative. While the event team works to accommodate common preferences, availability can be limited without advance notice. If you require gluten‑free, kosher, halal, or other specialized meals, contact the organizer before the deadline so they can coordinate with catering. Outside official functions, nearby dining options are listed in the mobile app or attendee guide. If you’re unsure what’s included with your badge, check the agenda for meal icons or notes; those mark where food and beverage are provided.
