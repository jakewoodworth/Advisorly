Sponsorship opportunities are typically organized into tiered levels that bundle visibility and engagement benefits. Common tiers include Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze, with options for a la carte add‑ons such as lanyards, charging stations, Wi‑Fi branding, app banners, or sponsored sessions. Higher tiers often provide premium logo placement, larger or priority exhibit space, speaking opportunities (where appropriate), lead retrieval, and access to attendee lists per event policy. Mid‑tier packages balance cost and visibility with sponsorship of breaks or receptions, while entry tiers offer essential brand exposure at an approachable price. Inventory is limited, and some benefits have production deadlines (e.g., signage or printed materials), so reserving early ensures the best selection. If your goals are specific—like driving booth traffic or hosting a customer meeting—ask about custom bundles or hospitality options. For details on current availability and pricing, request the prospectus or contact the sponsorship team listed on the event website.
