## Exhibiting puts your company in front of buyers and partners while the industry is together. Start by reviewing the floor plan and prospectus on the event website to pick an available booth size and location that fits your goals and budget. Submit the exhibit application or contract; once confirmed, you’ll receive a welcome kit with key deadlines, move‑in/move‑out schedules, and the exhibitor services manual. The manual lists approved vendors (decorator, electrical, internet, A/V), order forms, and shipping labels. Place orders early to avoid late fees and ensure inventory (carpet, furnishings, lead retrieval) is reserved. Next, register your booth staff using the complimentary badges included with your package and purchase any additional passes needed. Prepare your booth design and graphics to the specified dimensions, and confirm any rigging or hanging sign rules with the decorator. For promotions, submit your company listing, product categories, and any show specials by the marketing deadlines so attendees can find you in the app and directory. If you need help choosing a booth, contact the exhibits team listed on the website—they can advise on traffic patterns and availability.

Exhibiting connects your solutions with buyers and peers in a focused setting. Start by reviewing the exhibitor prospectus or prospect floor plan to select your preferred booth size and location. Submit the booth application with your company details and pay the deposit to secure space; assignments are typically first‑come, first‑served within priority windows. After confirmation, you’ll receive access to the exhibitor service kit with deadlines for forms, shipments, and on‑site services like electric, internet, and furnishings. Order these services early to avoid late fees. Coordinate with your marketing and sales teams on booth design, demos, staffing schedules, and giveaways, and confirm lead retrieval if offered. Review the exhibitor rules and regulations—especially installation/dismantle hours, height restrictions, and insurance requirements. Closer to the event, finalize your move‑in logistics, register your booth staff, and schedule meetings with key customers. If you need help choosing a space or planning an activation, contact the exhibits team listed on the event website for guidance and availability.
