Registering is quick and can be completed entirely online. Start on the event’s registration page and choose the registration type that matches your role (attendee, speaker, exhibitor, or sponsor). Create or sign in to your account, then provide your contact details and any required demographic or organization information. If the event offers member pricing, make sure your membership is active and associated with the same email you use to register—this ensures the correct rate is applied. You’ll be prompted to select optional items such as workshops, tours, or guest passes. During checkout, enter any discount codes, review the refund and substitution policy, and add payment details. Once you submit, you’ll receive a confirmation email; keep it handy for on-site check-in. If you’re registering a team, many systems support group registration so you can add multiple attendees in one transaction and pay once. For purchase orders or invoicing, contact the event team in advance to confirm options and deadlines. If you encounter issues at any step, the registration help link on the page is the fastest way to reach support and keep your registration on track.
