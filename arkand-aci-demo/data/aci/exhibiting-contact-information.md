For exhibiting inquiries, contact the exhibits team listed on the event website. Look for an “Exhibit” or “Exhibitor Information” page with a dedicated email and, often, a request form that routes your question to the floor manager. Include your company name, preferred booth size, target budget, and any special requirements (corner, island, height, rigging). If you already hold space, reference your booth number so staff can review your file. For services like carpet, electrical, internet, or freight, contact the official decorator and service providers found in the exhibitor services manual; the organizer can confirm the current vendors if you don’t have the kit. During move‑in and tear‑down, the service desk on the show floor is the quickest way to resolve time‑sensitive issues. If you need to coordinate sponsorship with your booth presence, ask to be connected with the sponsorship manager for bundled options.
