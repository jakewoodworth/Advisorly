Conference refund policies outline how and when fees can be returned if your plans change. Most events offer full or partial refunds up to a stated deadline, minus any administrative fee. After that date, refunds are typically not available, but you may be able to transfer the registration to a colleague. To request a refund, submit a written request to the registration team with your confirmation number and reason for cancellation. Refunds are usually issued to the original payment method and can take one to two billing cycles to appear, depending on your bank. If you booked housing through a conference block, remember to cancel your hotel separately to avoid room charges; hotel cancellation policies differ from event policies. Some registrations—such as deeply discounted or sponsor/exhibitor passes—may be non‑refundable. Always review the policy on the registration page before you purchase, and if you need exceptions due to documented emergencies, contact the event team promptly so they can advise on options.
