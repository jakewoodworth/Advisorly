Looking for conference information? Here’s how to find what you need quickly:

- Agenda and schedule: See the “Agenda” page or the event mobile app for session times, speakers, and room locations.
- Registration: Visit the registration page to start or modify a registration, apply discount codes, or request a receipt.
- Refunds and substitutions: Refer to the “Refund Policy and Deadline” FAQ and the registration page for exact dates.
- Sponsorship and exhibiting: Review the sponsorship prospectus and exhibitor information pages, or contact the sponsor/exhibits team listed there.
- Dietary needs: Indicate your preferences during registration or update your attendee profile before the posted deadline.

If you still need help, contact the event team:

- Email: Use the “Contact” link on the event site (includes registration, exhibits, and sponsorship contacts).
- On-site: Visit the registration/help desk during event hours.

Tip: Be as specific as possible (e.g., “refund deadline,” “booth dimensions,” “slides after event”) so we can direct you to the right resource.
