Sponsorship is a great way to reach decision‑makers and elevate your brand before, during, and after the conference. Start by requesting the current prospectus from the event team or downloading it from the sponsorship page. The prospectus outlines available packages, inventory, pricing, and key deadlines. Identify a level that aligns with your goals—brand visibility, thought leadership, lead generation, or hospitality—and confirm availability early, as high‑visibility placements sell out fast. After you select a package, you’ll receive a sponsorship agreement and an invoice; benefits are typically activated once payment is received. You’ll also get a checklist with deadlines for assets such as logos, ads, signage copy, and any deliverables for sponsored sessions or receptions. Work with your marketing team to craft clear messaging and booth or activation plans. If you need a custom package, ask—organizers can often tailor options based on your objectives and budget. For assistance at any step, contact the sponsorship manager listed on the event website.
