Looking for event information? Start with the event website and mobile app—they include the agenda, speakers, venue maps, exhibit hours, and announcements. The registration page lists pricing, what’s included, and refund/substitution policies. For travel planning, check the “Plan Your Visit” section for hotel details and transportation tips. If you need assistance, use the “Contact Us” link or the help icon in the app to reach registration, exhibits, or sponsorship teams. On site, visit the registration desk for badge issues, lost and found, accessibility support, and general questions. If your request is urgent during show hours, phone numbers and help desks are posted near entrances and on signage. For attendees from the same organization, share your confirmation details with colleagues to streamline support. Whether you’re confirming session times, ordering exhibitor services, or asking about CEU credits, contacting the specific team listed on the website will get you the fastest answer.
