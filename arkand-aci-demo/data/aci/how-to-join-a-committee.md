Joining a committee is a great way to contribute expertise, grow your network, and stay connected to emerging issues. Start by reviewing the list of active committees on the association’s website and identify those aligned with your role and interests. Each committee page typically outlines its mission, typical activities, and membership criteria. Many committees welcome new members year‑round; simply log in to your member profile and select the committees you’d like to join, or complete the short interest form. Some groups—like steering or policy committees—may require a nomination or appointment. After you join, you’ll receive welcome materials, meeting cadence, and communication preferences. Participation is flexible: most committees meet virtually on a regular schedule, with optional in‑person gatherings at major conferences. To get the most value, introduce yourself on the next call, volunteer for a small task, and keep your profile up to date so chairs can match you with relevant projects. If you need guidance, contact the committees team listed on the site.
