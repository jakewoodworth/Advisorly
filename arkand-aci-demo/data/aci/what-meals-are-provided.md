Meal offerings differ by event and location, but most conferences include light refreshments during scheduled breaks and at evening receptions noted as “all‑attendee.” Some programs also include continental breakfast or boxed lunches on select days when timing and venue logistics allow. The agenda is your authoritative source—look for icons or notes indicating where food and beverage are provided. If a meal is hosted within the exhibit hall, check those hours to plan accordingly. For attendees with dietary needs, many events label items for common allergens and provide vegetarian and vegan options during official functions. If your registration includes ticketed luncheons or special events, those will be explicitly listed in your confirmation and badge entitlements. When meals are not provided, nearby dining options are typically highlighted in the mobile app or on signage. If you rely on specific accommodations, we recommend carrying a backup snack and notifying the event team in advance so they can coordinate with catering to support your needs.
